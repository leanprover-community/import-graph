# Tools for analyzing imports.

Provides the commands

* `#redundant_imports` which lists any transitively redundant imports in the current module.
* `#min_imports` which attempts to construct a minimal set of imports for the declarations
  in the current file.
  (Must be run at the end of the file. Tactics and macros may result in incorrect output.)
* `#find_home decl` suggests files higher up the import hierarchy to which `decl` could be moved.
* `#import_diff foo bar ...` computes the new transitive imports that are added to a given file when
  modules `foo, bar, ...` are added to the set of imports of the file.
